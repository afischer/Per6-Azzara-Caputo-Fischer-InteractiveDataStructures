HEY TEAM OF BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!  
Here, we keep track of our lovely little project in timeline form. Because, yeah, we do eventually have to finish this if we don't want Mr. K to throw things at us.  
  
SO. Keep most important things on the top, check them off as you go. Yaay. -AFF

- [x] Decide which data structure we want to make a representation of first (Personally, I think a binary search tree with enterable elements would be an easy place to start and learn processing)
- [ ] Write README
- [ ] Use good markdown syntax pls.
- [ ] EVERYONE Read CONVENTIONS.md
- [ ] Finish this list...
- [ ] Make sure that Andrew knows how to spell binary properly
- [ ] Make sure we have working codes of all the data structures we want to include
