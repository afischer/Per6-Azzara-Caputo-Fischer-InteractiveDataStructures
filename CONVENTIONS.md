These are the ten commandments of our project, except there will probably be more than ten commandments, because yolo and also we need to keep the code looking nice and consistant and this is where we start, so please, don't not follow these rules thinking you're some type of rebel maniac because you're not, and it's not funny, and I will come and get you and find you and ruin you. That is all.
